1) code optimization
2) add another types of jigsaws
3) documentation
4) clever z-index
5) ??? maybe create separated classes for puzzle piece and canvas ??? "merge", and some getters can be methods of this class
6) make prototype for jigsaws, implement common functions (makeTransparent, getSize)
7) rectangle algorithm could be simplified to just putImageData
